Internet and Email Policy
Our Internet and Email Policy is established to guide the responsible and secure use of these essential tools within our organization. We recognize their significance in daily business operations and the importance of adhering to principles that maintain security, productivity, and legal compliance.
Acceptable Use: Company-provided internet and email services are primarily meant for job-related tasks. Limited personal use is allowed during non-work hours, provided it doesn't interfere with work responsibilities.
Security: Safeguard your login credentials, avoiding the sharing of passwords. Exercise caution with email attachments and links from unknown sources. Promptly report any unusual online activity or potential security breaches.
Confidentiality: Reserve email for the transmission of confidential information, trade secrets, and sensitive customer data only when encryption is applied. Exercise discretion when discussing company matters on public forums or social media.
Harassment and Inappropriate Content: Internet and email usage must not involve harassment, discrimination, or the distribution of offensive or inappropriate content. Show respect and sensitivity to others in all online communications.
Compliance: Ensure compliance with all relevant laws and regulations regarding internet and email usage, including those related to copyright and data protection.
Monitoring: The company retains the right to monitor internet and email usage for security and compliance purposes.
Consequences: Policy violations may lead to disciplinary measures, including potential termination.
Our Internet and Email Policy aims to promote safe, responsible usage of digital communication tools that align with our values and legal obligations. Each employee is expected to understand and follow this policy. Regular reviews ensure its alignment with evolving technology and security standards.
